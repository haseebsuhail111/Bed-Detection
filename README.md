# Bed Detection and Cropping using YOLOv8

This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model from the [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) library to detect beds in an image and crop them out. Cropped bed images are saved in a `cropped_images` directory.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Use Case

Given a room image, this script automatically detects any beds and saves cropped versions of those beds for further analysis or classification.
